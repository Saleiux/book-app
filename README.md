### Guidelines 

The project must satisfy the following requirements:

- The application must be composed of a simple textbox (Google style) to allow the user to search all the books of a specific category.
- Once the user clicks on a button, the application should contact the Open Library external service APIs: https://openlibrary.org
- The application once retrieved the list of books will only display the title and the list of authors. 
- When the user clicks on a book or a special button, the application must be able to view the description of the book.

## Process

This is how I built my project 

### Built with

- SASS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Axios
- Babel

### What I learned

In this project i put in practice what I learned during the Javascript Advanced course of Start2impact University. 
<br>
This was the first project that put me to test my-self. I add to use in the project a lot of new tools for me and I had a lot of problem that made me redo and reread the code many times.
But at the end I was able to create my own app and Iâ€™m satisfied and happy for everything I learned.
